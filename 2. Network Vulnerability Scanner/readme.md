### Discription
A bash script that performs an Nmap scan on a target host and saves the results to a file. The script starts by checking if the number of arguments passed to the script is equal to 1. If not, it displays the usage instructions and exits.

Next, it generates a timestamp for the output file name and sets the target host variable. Then, it runs an Nmap scan on the target host using the -T4, -A, -p-, and -oN options. The -T4 option specifies a fast scan, -A enables OS detection, -p- specifies all ports, and -oN specifies the name of the output file.

Finally, the script displays a message indicating that the scan is complete and saves the results to the output file. 
### HOW TO USE

Save this script to a file, `network_scanner.sh`, and make it executable:


``` 
chmod +x network_scanner.sh 
```
You can then run the script by providing the target IP or hostname:

```
./network_scanner.sh 192.168.1.1
```

This script uses Nmap to perform a comprehensive scan (`-A` option) on all ports (`-p-` option) of the specified target. The results are saved in a timestamped text file.

Please note that using network scanning tools on systems or networks without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have the appropriate permissions before conducting any security-related activities.
