### Description
The above code is a Bash script for web application security scanning. It has two functions, check_sql_injection() and check_xss(), which perform two security checks: SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

The script takes one argument, the target URL, which is passed to the curl command to fetch the homepage of the target website. The script then uses grep to search for the presence of error, exception, or warning messages, which may indicate a SQL injection or XSS vulnerability.

The script performs both checks sequentially and outputs the results to the console.

### HOW TO USE
Save this script to a file, `web_security_scanner.sh`. Make it executable using the command:
 ```
 chmod +x web_security_scanner.sh
 ```
 
 You can then run it by providing the target URL as an argument:

```
./web_security_scanner.sh http://example.com

```
This script checks for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities by injecting payloads into the target URL and analyzing the responses. Always ensure you have explicit permission before scanning any web application.
